Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. This project involves EDA on a dataset of restaurants to understand various factors such as ratings, popularity, location and other key metrics.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes information about restaurants, such as their names, locations, ratings,reviews, and more. Ensure you have the dataset available before running the analysis.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and some libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file should include the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/restaurant-eda.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Open and run the notebook Cognifyz.ipynb to perform the analysis.
EDA Process
The EDA process includes the following steps:

Data Loading: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
Data Visualization: Create visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
Insights and Observations: Summarize the key insights and observations from the analysis.
Results
The results of the EDA will include visualizations and insights into the restaurant data, such as:

Distribution of restaurant ratings
Relationship between the number of reviews and ratings
Popular cuisines and locations
Other relevant metrics and patterns
